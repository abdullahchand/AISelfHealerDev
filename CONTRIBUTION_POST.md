# 🚀 Just Open-Sourced: AI-Based Developer Runtime Environment

Hey developers! 👋

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on: **SRE_Auto** - an AI-powered developer runtime environment that autonomously manages, fixes, and optimizes your development setup.

## 🧠 What it does:
- **Self-healing runtime environment** with AI agents
- **Zero manual debugging** - AI detects and fixes issues automatically
- **Real-time web dashboard** for monitoring and control
- **Modular worker agents** for different applications/services
- **gRPC communication** between master and worker agents

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Backend**: Python 3.12, FastAPI, gRPC, OpenAI API
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, WebSocket
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT models + local Transformers
- **CLI**: Typer with Rich UI

## ⚠️ Important Note:
This project is **nowhere near complete** and is very much in active development. There might be bugs, incomplete features, and documentation issues. I'm sharing it early to get community feedback and contributions.

## 🤝 Looking for Contributors:
I'd love help with:
- **Bug fixes** and testing
- **Feature development** (especially the AI analysis engine)
- **Documentation improvements**
- **Frontend enhancements** (React dashboard)
- **Performance optimizations**
- **New use cases** and integrations

## 🚀 Quick Start:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd SRE_Auto
conda create -n ai-runtime python=3.12
conda activate ai-runtime
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
ai-runtime start
```

## 📊 Current Status:
- ✅ Basic agent architecture
- ✅ gRPC communication
- ✅ CLI interface
- ✅ Web dashboard (basic)
- ✅ AI integration (OpenAI)
- 🔄 Self-healing logic (in progress)
- 🔄 Advanced monitoring (in progress)
- 🔄 Production readiness (needs work)

## 💡 Vision:
Imagine never having to manually debug port conflicts, missing dependencies, or crashed services again. This system learns from your environment and fixes issues before you even notice them.
